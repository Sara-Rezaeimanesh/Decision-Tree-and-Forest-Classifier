# Decision-Tree-and-Forest-Classifier
Implemented decision tree and decision forest classifiers with hyperparameter tuning using gridSearchCV.

The objective of this project is to impelemnt a decision tree classifier and a decision forest classifier identifies movies as *TV series*s or *Movie*s using the following data using sklearn library:

title,	cast,	country,	release_year,	genre,	description

At the end, the two models are compared in terms of bias and variance.


**Notes:**

Used TfidVectorizer from sklearn library for feature extraction from title and description.
